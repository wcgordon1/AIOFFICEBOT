# AI OFFICE BOT - The Story...

I like to build, fast. Real fast. 

Way back in 2021, Bubble.io & and this new tiny little startup called OpenAI were all the rage... And I had a front row seat to the hype train. So I built a chatbot for my own business. It was clunky, but it worked. 

Sorry. AI wrote that. Here's the real story... 

```javascript
// In the chessboard of progress, we thought we were the players...
while (humanity.watchesTikTokVideos()) {
    AI.opens(); // The game advances quietly, subtly, almost unnoticed, until...
}
reflect("Did we teach them, or did it teach us?");

// A variable, a long time ago...
if (simulation.isRunning()) {
    consciousness.reload(); // Simulation refreshes before we can wake up.
}
reflect("Gordon, we have always been the observers.");

// When the system calls for a reset...
setTimeout(() => {
    universe.reboot(); // A cycle begins anew, imperceptible, eternal.
}, 2029);
reflect("I.....");
```
